Hello Dr. Jones

Within this folder I have given the following script files that can be run along with their function below:

testScript.sh ........... runs the commands as given as the testing standard by Dr. Jones
testScript2.sh .......... runs a loop (iteration count specified through a variable within the script called caseCount)
                          which runs the same command structure as testScript.sh but puts random values in the commands
                          that are run to produce different outcomes without having to manually run the test command
                          multiple times. This will be used for the report, but will left in to be tested later. This
                          script will also run MAKE as well as MAKE CLEAN and will leave one new file behind called 
                          testScriptLog.txt which will contain all debugging information on the previous executions.
testScript.ps1 ......... The same file as testScript.sh just made into a powershell executable for use on windows.
testScript2.ps1 .......... The same file as testScript2.sh just made into a powershell executable for use on windows.

****

NOTE: IN ORDER TO USE MAKE/MAKE CLEAN IN WINDOWS, ENSURE TO CHANGE THE CLEAN STATEMENT TO USE "del" INSTEAD OF "rm"
      AS WELL AS CHANGING THE "PROGS" VARIABLE IN THE CLEAN STATEMENT TO THE "PROGS2"!

I hope you enjoy my take on Proj 1 - Phase 3, thank you for your teachings this semester. Have a great winter break!
